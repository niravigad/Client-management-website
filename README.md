# Client management Assignment

Build a simple website that will be our clients database.
Use any programming language you feel comfortable with.
A client has the following attributes:

● Full Name 
● ID - Teudat Zehut (תעודת זהות) 
● Phone number 
● IP address 

Here’s a link for initial data - 50 valid customers - link
The website must have the following features:
● Show the existing clients

● Add and remove a client

● Filter the clients (e.g. all the clients with the surname “Cohen”)

● Input fields should be validated (at least at minimum level) - both on frontend and backend
Extra points are per the course you take. If you feel more comfortable with frontend development do the
frontend extras - same for the backend extras.


Frontend Extras:
● Use any JS framework you are comfortable with (or plain vanilla js)

● For each client IP, show some geo information about the IP address. You can use any API you find
online. For example - https://ip-api.com/

● You don’t have to use a database at the backend side, but it’s better if you do :)

● Responsiveness for different screen sizes (tablets, mobile phones etc)


Backend Extras:
● Usage of a database - A must. You can use SQL, NoSQL, anything you feel comfortable with

● When adding a new client, use some IP information API and store the geo data from it (city,
country) so we can later query by it (Bonus points here!). You can use any API you find online.
For example - https://ip-api.com/

● ID field should be validated according to Israeli ID validation guidelines
