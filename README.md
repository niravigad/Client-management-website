# Client management Assignment

Build a simple website that will be our clients database.
Use any programming language you feel comfortable with.
A client has the following attributes:

● Full Name 

● ID - Teudat Zehut (תעודת זהות)

● Phone number 

● IP address 


The website must have the following features:

● Show the existing clients

● Add and remove a client

● Filter the clients (e.g. all the clients with the surname “Cohen”)

● Input fields should be validated (at least at minimum level) - both on frontend and backend
Extra points are per the course you take. If you feel more comfortable with frontend development do the
frontend extras - same for the backend extras.


Frontend Extras:

● Use any JS framework you are comfortable with (or plain vanilla js)

● For each client IP, show some geo information about the IP address. You can use any API you find
online. For example - https://ip-api.com/

● You don’t have to use a database at the backend side, but it’s better if you do :)

● Responsiveness for different screen sizes (tablets, mobile phones etc)


Backend Extras:

● Usage of a database - A must. You can use SQL, NoSQL, anything you feel comfortable with

● When adding a new client, use some IP information API and store the geo dat

a from it (city,
country) so we can later query by it (Bonus points here!). You can use any API you find online.
For example - https://ip-api.com/

● ID field should be validated according to Israeli ID validation guidelines
